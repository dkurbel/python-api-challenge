# WeatherPy folder contains a jupyter notebook file, an output_data folder containing png images and end result csv file to read in VacationPy exercise.
# The WeatherPy code requests current weather data for random cities and plots various attributes by each city Latitude, including Line of Regression and comments on the strength of correlation.

# This code reduces the WeatherPy city data to rows that meet the following:
#   70-80 degrees F Max Temperature
#   Less than 10 mph Wind Speed

# Then, the code requests data to find the first hotel within 10,000m radius of the city coordinates.
